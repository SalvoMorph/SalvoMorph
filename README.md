ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SalvoMorph

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in a lot of things, all involving technology in particular.

ðŸŒ± I've some hobbies:
- SSC Napoli
- Photography

- Domotics
ðŸ“« How to reach me: www.salvatorecattano.it

I am lucky enough to interface with many people around the world. \
This allows me to know the ways of doing and thinking, and to learn new useful information for my cultural background.

There is never an end to learning new things, both humanly and professionally speaking.

Learning without thinking is wasted effort.
Thinking without learning is dangerous.

Wisdom and common sense are obtained in three ways:
- First with reflection, which is the noblest thing;
- Second through imitation, which is the simplest thing; 
- Third with experience, which is the bitterest thing of all.
